# Version Control Workflow — [Project Name]

## 1. Overview

This document describes the Git-based version control workflow used for this

Machine Learning project, developed as part of MLOps Lab Experiment 2.

- **Repository:** https://github.com/<your-username>/ml-mlops-lab2

- **Primary language:** Python

- **Maintainer(s):** [Your Name]

## 2. Branching Strategy

| Branch            | Purpose                                             |

|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------|

| `main`             | Stable, always-deployable code                       |

| `develop`          | Integration branch for day-to-day development         |

| `feature/<name>`   | Individual features, branched from and merged back into `develop` |

| `conflict-demo-*`  | Demonstration branches created for conflict resolution practice |

**Rule:** No one commits directly to `main`. All changes flow:

`feature/*` → Pull Request → `develop` → (periodically) merged into `main`.

## 3. Commit Convention

Commits follow a short, imperative style with a type prefix:

## feat: add new functionality fix: correct a bug docs: documentation changes chore: tooling/config changes refactor: code change with no behavior change

Example: `feat: add classification report to training script`

## 4. Standard Workflow (Feature Development)

```bash

git switch develop

git pull origin develop

git switch -c feature/<short-description>

# ... make changes ...

git add <files>

git commit -m "feat: <description>"

git push -u origin feature/<short-description>

# Open a Pull Request into `develop` on GitHub

# After review/approval, merge via GitHub (squash or merge commit)

git branch -d feature/<short-description>          # clean up locally

git push origin --delete feature/<short-description> # clean up remote

```

## 5. Merge Conflict Resolution Process

1. Attempt the merge/rebase; Git flags conflicting files.

2. Open each conflicted file and locate `<<<<<<<` / `=======` / `>>>>>>>` markers.

3. Decide which change(s) to keep — current, incoming, or a manual combination.

4. Remove all conflict markers.

5. `git add <file>` to mark the conflict as resolved.

6. `git commit` (or continue the rebase) to finalize.

7. Test the code (`python src/train.py`) before pushing to confirm nothing broke.

## 6. .gitignore Policy for ML Artifacts

Large or generated files are excluded from Git and are expected to be tracked

separately (e.g., via DVC, cloud storage, or Git-LFS) rather than committed directly:

- Raw/processed datasets (`data/*.csv`, `data/*.parquet`)

- Model checkpoints/binaries (`*.pkl`, `*.h5`, `*.pt`, `models/`)

- Virtual environments (`.venv/`, `venv/`, `env/`)

- Notebook checkpoints (`.ipynb_checkpoints/`)

## 7. Pull Request Checklist

- [ ] Code runs without errors (`python src/train.py`)

- [ ] No large data/model files accidentally staged

- [ ] Commit messages follow the convention in §3

- [ ] Branch is up to date with `develop` before merging

- [ ] PR description explains *what* changed and *why*

## 8. Verification Log

| Check                                              | Status |

|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|

| `git --version` ≥ 2.30                              | ✅ |

| `git log --oneline --graph --all` shows merged branches | ✅ |

| Repository has 3+ branches                          | ✅ |

| Repository has 1+ merged Pull Request                | ✅ |

| `python src/train.py` runs and prints Accuracy       | ✅ |

naming conventions adopted, tools used (gh CLI vs web UI), etc.]~
